I have examined WikiData web site.
Below is an example Wiki Markdown language usage.
  1. fruits
     * apple
     * banana
  2. vegetables
     - carrot
     - broccoli

For GitHub part; push, pull, commit, add, branch, merge are critical functions.
  Pull requests informs others about changes I have made to a branch in a repository.
  Push command updates the remote branch with local commits.
  The git merge command lets us take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.
